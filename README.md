## 5. Features / Highlights  

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard  
- Explore **trends in player ownership & engagement**  
- Compare **platform dominance (Windows, Mac, Linux)**  
- Analyze **age-based restrictions** and content categories  
- Visualize **publisher distribution & cross-platform releases**  

### 📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals  
- **Count of Owners & Genres by Age Rating**  
  Most games are rated for all audiences (age 0), and ownership is highest here. Games with higher age ratings (16, 18) have very low ownership.  

- **Median Playtime & Genre Count by Platform**  
  Windows dominates both in playtime and genre variety. Mac and Linux show much lower player engagement.  

- **Category Distribution by Required Age**  
  Categories are concentrated in age 0 (general audience) games, while restricted categories have fewer titles.  

- **Publisher & App Distribution by Platforms**  
  - ~70% of games are **Windows-only**  
  - Cross-platform publishing exists (Windows + Mac/Linux), but remains limited  
  - Pure Mac/Linux exclusives are rare  

### 💡 Business Impact & Insights  
- **Windows remains the primary platform** for PC gaming, driving the highest engagement and publisher support.  
- **Cross-platform opportunities** exist but are underutilized, showing potential growth areas.  
- **General audience games** dominate the market, meaning content aimed at all ages reaches the largest user base.  
- **Publishers focusing on Windows exclusivity** may miss cross-platform revenue opportunities.
